# Student Performance Prediction and Visualization

This project aims to analyze student performance data, perform data visualization to gain insights, and build a neural network model to predict student scores using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

In this project, we use machine learning and data visualization techniques to understand the factors that influence student performance. We employ a neural network model to predict students' exam scores based on various features such as attendance, extracurricular activities, access to resources, and more.

## Key Features:

Data Visualization: Visualizes the relationships between different variables and their influence on student performance.
Neural Network Model: A model to predict student exam scores using features such as attendance, extracurricular activities, and other factors.
Dataset
The dataset contains various attributes that can impact student performance, such as:

## Hours Studied
Attendance
Parental Involvement
Access to Resources
Extracurricular Activities
Sleep Hours
Previous Scores
Motivation Level
Internet Access
Tutoring Sessions
Family Income
Teacher Quality
School Type
Peer Influence
Physical Activity
Learning Disabilities
Parental Education Level
Distance from Home
Gender

## Project Components
Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned and transformed the dataset.
Handled missing data and normalized the features.

Data Visualization:
Visualized relationships between various factors and student performance.
